# Boston-House-Price-Prediction
The problem that we are going to solve here is that given a set of features that describe a house in Boston, our machine learning model must predict the house price. To train our machine learning model with boston housing data, we will be using scikit-learn's boston dataset
Linear Regression is the algorithm that is used for predicting House prices among various other algorithms.
